# Antivirus-Sample

This antivirus project is designed to detect and remove malicious software by scanning files for known virus signatures. It leverages a database of common virus signatures to identify potential threats and take appropriate action.

Key Features

Signature Database: The project includes a database of common virus signatures. These signatures are patterns or sequences of bytes that are unique to known viruses.
File Scanning: The antivirus program scans files on the system, comparing their contents against the virus signature database to detect any matches.
Detection and Removal: When a virus signature is detected, the program can either quarantine the infected file or attempt to remove the malicious code.
User Interface: The project may include a simple user interface to allow users to initiate scans, view scan results, and manage detected threats.
Regular Updates: The signature database can be regularly updated to include new virus signatures, ensuring the antivirus program remains effective against the latest threats.

How It Works
Initialization: The program loads the virus signature database into memory.
Scanning: The user selects files or directories to scan. The program reads the contents of each file and compares them against the virus signatures.
Detection: If a match is found, the program flags the file as potentially infected.
Action: The user is notified of the detection and can choose to quarantine or remove the infected file
